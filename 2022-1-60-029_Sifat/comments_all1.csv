What's actually impressive is the AI stuff, however I don't know how practical it is at this stage - it feels more gimmicky than anything else. I can just type to ChatGPT instead of using Siri, and I have AI in my search engine now as well, so the new AI siri is like nice to have, but not needed. All the AI stuff with emojis and photo editing seems rather niche as well. Overall iOS 18 was the only exciting thing about this year for Apple, as we got needed changes to daily apps like the calculator app, notes, journal + got Android features like RCS, ability to move icons where you want, some customization, etc. Overall I think phones are just so good now that any new changes are quite minor and just refinement more than something people need.",1727740800,0,

My 1st iPhone was the 3GS in 2009 and I then held off for four years until the 5S in 2013.  The difference was staggering.  I then switched to 6S+ two years later in 2015, but then held off again until iPhone 11 in 2019.  I've had the 11 for five years now and still find it perfectly usable...I'm using 53 of 64 GB, so I'm not running out of room, most apps still work seamlessly, with only a few getting laggy, and it's eligible for iOS 18 (the update appears in Software Update as I type this comment).  I'm not a hardcore pro user, I rarely use the camera for more than the occasional snapshot or selfie, I don't use it for many games, so while the 16 looks great and would make a huge leap ahead of my 11, I'm leaning toward waiting another year.  The reason I switched from 3GS to 5S was because I ran out of eligibility for iOS updates (I held on until the newest update wasn't supported on 3GS)...I switched to 6S+ because the larger screen was too tempting and I had just paid off the 5S on AT&T Next, and I switched to 11 because the 6S+ had become super laggy and I kept running out of storage and had to keep deleting or offloading apps, but there is currently no compelling reason for me to upgrade right now.  The Apple Intelligence stuff looks good, but it won't be available on the 16 out of the box, so I might as well wait until iPhone 17 when they've had time to improve it even more with iOS 19.",1727740800,0,

Google, Samsung, Motorola, etc. push for innovation and new concepts year after year. For example: the Flip series for both Samsung and Motorola are extremely impressive. While they have issues with trying to make the folding screen less fragile, it is extremely impressive that they are willing to try something new to give their consumers what they've been asking for. Yet, Apple consistently puts out identical iterations of their phones alongside features literally nobody has asked for or care for. I cannot think of a single person or influencer who has asked for a camera specific slide bar or apple AI, yet we have all been begging for cooler colors in the Pro Max, a flip version, and customization. Even though allegedly they are coming out with customization with the new update, it does not seem to be to the degree that andriod products have.

It might not be a big deal going  from 15 to 16 because you get to upgrade every year, going from 12 to 16 is a big deal. So showing us a comparisons of what it’s like going from pro max 12 to pro max 16 (which is apparently one of the largest group of people upgrading  this year) would be a meaningful information and super helpful rather than ‘you aren’t getting much from 15 to 16’ because that isn’t statistically your target audience. 😊",1727740800,5,

Your idea of a major upgrade is slapping a new number on the same old design and calling it ‘revolutionary.’ It’s like you’re stuck on repeat, playing the same old tune while everyone else is dropping chart-toppers. You’ve turned ‘predictable’ into an art form, and your innovation looks like it’s on vacation. People are starting to wonder if your new iPhones come with a side of déjà vu.

I’d be interested to see any other phone update review and see if it’d receive any hate if it was just only a reskin. lol but I do agree with some of the stuff I’m not saying I disagree…. Like the new phones launching with the old os is insane to me. Wow. It’s so bad I can’t comprehend it. Like we need to sell them now I get it…. But like… you can’t have them use the new software?? Why? Will it be different in a month vs right now? Idk I think it’s a massive fumble to not launch with the new os when the new os has so so so so so many changes. Then to design the new phone around an os that’s not even on the phone is wild to me. Terrible decision. Still cool tho I can’t wait to get my new phone. My current one is okay but it’s ancient.

I believe that if you read my comments and even more importantly, watch the video I've referenced that you will feel that it is the right thing, for both yourself and for your subscribers, to share this info.  As I mentioned, the video was made by 2 professional photographers (husband and wife) who are CHEERING for Apple to make a proper effort in improving the camera quality of iPhones with each subsequent generation, but are not finding that that is what is happening.  Certainly form your own opinion and I'd love to hear your response.  It’s only 15:56 long and it is packed with info!  I believe if you watch it that you too will be providing feedback to Apple, holding them accountable to make genuine improvements and abandoning their misdirection about their camera quality, using their creative method of coming up with camera specifications. It will definitely be worth your time to watch.  I’ve posted these comments on a couple of other channels as well, because it's important that this education correcting misleading marketing, be put out there.  BONUS: The lenses on the iPhone 14 Pro are better than on the 15 Pro and the 3x Zoom on the 15 Pro is better than the 5x zoom on the 16 Pro.  Unfortunately, Apple has done away with the 3x zoom on the 16 Pro.  Below, I have listed the details on where to find the video and I’ve also provided some timeframes where key info is communicated.  I hope you’ll be happy to gain this education!  Title: iPhone 16 Pro camera: DISAPPOINTING & MISLEADING Channel: Tony & Chelsea Northrup  Times: 4:45 to 7:06 | Main Lens iPhone 48 MP vs Digital Camera48 MP This is in reality a 12 MP lens with pixels divided into 4 sub-pixels. Result? File size 4x bigger! But “effective” resolution (sharpness) is comparable to a 6 MP lens!!  So, why do this?  Two Reasons. Reason #1 Marketing & specsmanship Reason #2 Bigger files means more storage requirements on phone AND iCloud, means, higher monthly cost for iCloud for increased capacity requirement.  7:12 to 7:52 | DNG vs HEIC HEIC allows for “Live” photos and uses much less space.  The image is also excessively hyped with resolution and Gamma, resulting grainer photos and washed-out images.  DNG is the opposite.  Much better image quality, but at the expense of a huge file size.  8:31 to 15:56 | iPhone’s fake 2x lens Upshot - “Effective” resolution (how it looks compared to a digital camera) is resolution looks like a 3 MP image!!  10:34 to 11:42 | 85 mm - iPhone 16 12 MP vs Digital Camera 12 MP Upshot - “Effective” resolution of iPhone’s 12 MP looks substantially WORSE than a 2.7 MP image from a digital camera!!  11:42 to 12:55 | Why 5x stinks on the iPhone 16 Pro Upshot - iPhone 16 Pro accomplishes 5x zoom by taking a 48 MP lens - that renders an image roughly as sharp as a 6 MP lens - but then CROPPING that image, which renders an image on par with a roughly 1/2 MP lens!!!",1727740800,0,

They also offer tents made with nickel-copper woven fabric. You can also buy the fabric. i'm new to all of this so what is your opinion on faraday technology.  Thanks again for being so forthcoming in your reviews. :face-fuchsia-flower-shape:💌",1727740800,0,

Truth of the matter is that Iphone and Samsung are like Ronaldo and Messi, they are both great and the best there is, I believe changing phone year to year is not so beneficial, that's why the changes are not that big, I have to admit this goes for Samsung aswell, these phones are imo better suited and wanted if you have an older model.

You could say they are bound by keeping their self-made deadlines when a new phone needs to come out.

Along with (again, older model) battery life drain for which both the first and latter only needed a simple software patch, THat was fixed, after a lawsuit, I digress) I would ponder on the idea of skipping a RAM upgrade for 14PM’s, longer and with a bad taste in my mouth along with considering it a more nefarious coalition.

Almost a decade ago, a British car market named McLaren, introduced a supercar that almost turned the automotive industry on its head.  It was called the 720.  Nothing could beat it. Some 5 or so years later, McLaren introduced a car called the GT. The GT had numbers that were close to the 720.  But, it added something else. It added all day driving comforts.   Did McLaren miss an opportunity to one up the 720’s performance numbers? No.  It wanted to make a car that was, for lack of a better term, more livable.   Sometimes it’s not the numbers.  Sometimes it is about the upgrade makes technology more livable.   For now, just know that Apple isn’t investing so much into the hardware enhancements / upgrades stuff.  It is focusing on how their devices can enhance one’s life.  It seeks to do so by way of smart software solutions.  Last, congrats on the win down under. I am proud of you.

This isn’t just iPhones this is all phones.   People act like every single year these cellphone companies are supposed to blow us away with some new kind of innovation, that’s not realistic.   Nobody expects you to buy a new phone every single year. Not even these companies, I’m sure they I wish you did. Years ago when phones were rapidly advancing, and they were also cheaper, people would upgrade every 2 years. That doesn’t make sense anymore so people tend to upgrade every 4 years.   Companies like Samsung and Apple aren’t trying to blow us away every year, they’re simply improving their proven products and they know that there’s a percentage of consumers who are due for an upgrade, who will be happy for some new features.",1727740800,8,

And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

The airpods kinda get pro features...and the airpod pros get minor updates which the main thing being for hearing that they feel everyone will need.  The phones literally got a slight camera upgrade, minor tweaks in the material used, and a camera button because after years of doing it all on screen they want us to relearn to use a button that adds absolutely nothing new. And because of how minor everything was they ended up talking more about ios and AI than the phones themselves.  people might as well buy last years pro and save money.  Worse was how apple boast that those in the US get up to $1000 trade in -- everywhere else gets laughable trade in prices. I'm from the UK and Apple offer the lowest trade in values even though they have banged on about wanting to be net zero by 2030 - surely they should be offering better trade in values so they can make sure their items are reused, restored, or recycled",1727740800,0,

You can assign the default shortcut on the Lock Screen (which I liked) to something else that you want without loosing the ability to quickly take a photo or video. This looks like  a small win for apple but uses the community to assimilate a behavior to further deviate their customers from competitors while attracting people who swear by their competitors camera on their smart phone. Reintroducing a physical behavior with software has a brainwashing effect. Kids from the 90’s and 00’s had cameras and this has a nostalgic effect on people who stopped buying cameras because they had smart phones.,1727740800,0,

Asking for a 5000 mAh battery seems unrealistic, as Apple rarely meets expectations, despite 5000 mAh being standard in many other phones. My second hope is to see a 120Hz OLED display in both their flagship and budget models. Lastly, I would like to see a proper 8K camera, as this feature has already been implemented by other brands. I don’t need an extra toggle button on the side, which is difficult to access and only toggles the camera or activates Apple Intelligence — a feature we will receive months later with a software update. Most of these capabilities can already be achieved through Google Lens or ChatGPT, so the additional button feels redundant.The iPhone 16 launch was a disappointment.

UgxHHXKJT3b6OafFwH54AaABAg,root,@KhalsaSoulja,"So this is purely speculation, but here's my take.  Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway sold 390million shares of Apple stock, i've seen figures of around $6.2Billion of Apple shares being sold from news articles dated as early as the 4th of August 2024.   Just over a week after Berkshire Hathaway selling their apple shares, Apple release the iPhone 16 which is abysmal to say the least. I'd argue one of Apples worst iPhone ('updates') launches!   Again, purely speculation and i may be connecting dots that don't exist, but i think there's been some inside trading here from Berkshire Hathaway. There's a leak within Apple that Berkshire tapped into and as a result of this clearly shitty product launch decided to pull their shares!  This iPhone is not innovative, infact this whole product launch lacks innovation. The camera button that acts similarly to a DSLR is so gimmicky, this is something you'd see tested on Android phones like Bixby, not on Apple iPhones. I highly doubt this additional button will continue going forward on Apple products.   Apple needs to do better, for themselves, their investors and their consumers.  This is absolute shite!

I hate Face ID. - Moving the Close button from the right side to the top of the case, where it came from.  I understand apple loves clean lines and the button on top is not as aesthetically pleasing as the side, in symmetry with the volume buttons.

The software from Apple is excellent mainly due to the integration through out. I have been using the Samsung Flip 6 since its launch, and can say that I can do most if not everything Apple’s new phones present. But the fragmented nature of Android has proven to be a pain, simple things like lowering sound output of media when a notification arrives needs a specific configuration, fingerprint and face locks do not work well when operated together, getting the thing to be practical requires a bunch of configuration tweaks and additional software. Apple’s eco systems works very well. But damn I am fed up with the form factor. A flip of some sort would be a game changer. Using an iPhone pro Max is a joke in summer, this size is becoming really annoying. My Flip 6 is a very good form factor I love it, but man the software ecosystem system is a nightmare.

The ultra as mainly a prestige accessory because it is not really adding a lot of features compared to a normal apple watch.

I’m relieved that Tim Cook ditched him. He seems oblivious to the distinctiveness and culture of Apple, behaving as if he has superior knowledge. For instance, his criticism of Apple’s 60 Hz display in 2024, suggesting Apple is behind the times, misses the point. Apple’s 60 Hz performance is superior to 120 Hz displays from other brands because of their integrated approach to hardware and software. Mark my words, his influence will wane. He lacks professionalism in his reviews, and though I respect him as a person, his obvious bias undermines his credibility as a tech reviewer.

They know how to tap into the desire for exclusivity, even if the actual improvements are marginal. The sad part is that many people, especially those who might not have the means, buy into this hype, spending a premium on what is essentially the same phone with minor tweaks.The hardware and software might be solid, but the constant cycle of new releases with barely noticeable changes feels more like a cash grab than genuine innovation.

We've become so spoiled by these devices and the overall ecosystems of tech we live in, we don't fully appreciate how difficult it is to cater to ""us"" because we take so much for granted.   Which makes most of us both choosy and highly prone to being manipulated by small, almost incremental improvements which are enough to signal ""status"" but not really necessary if you already have a fairly recent version.

At least this year “it’s on par” with the pro. The new colours are sick. Pro colours not so much, actually really boring. But at least the non-max is on par technically. 128gb base storage is much more of a crime than 60hz. After all most people don’t need high refresh rate and this way you save on battery.

Funny enough the competition is making sure that their phones look like iPhone. They went curved edges to flat screens, from rounded corners to square like apple, even with the colours, they’re trying to mimic apple. Samsung earbuds are now sticking out like the AirPod. So much for being better than someone yet wanting to look like him to make sale. I was at best buy today just to find out that the price of the galaxy s24 ultra drop up to $250, after the release of the new iPhone. If they have nothing to worry about, and if the new iPhone is a flop, why being in panic mode. Never have I seen apple drop their prices that much upon a new release of the competition. I’m an iPhone user, and I don’t advocate for Apple but, if someone is always looking for your flaws, you’re certainly doing something better than him.

UgxPkvaxbF-YdqzMMdh4AaABAg,root,@Toxic_Waste92,"For me, I have 2 issues with the device. The first being that camera button… I don’t see myself using that to flip between modes on my camera. But the sensor is a forced cut out on cases for the device. I wish I could just turn the button off and have a full protective case without the button exposed as if it wasn’t even there. I work in road construction painting lines on the road. I am often around different pavement marking materials, the glass beads used to make lines reflective and when we fabricate things we are often surrounded by metal dust. I’d prefer to not have this button cut out of the case and be a prime point for dust, dirt, paint and glass bead to make it inside my case/phone.  Next is MagSafe. I find it pointless as wireless charging has never really been something I use for my phone and the magnets do nothing for me but attract metal dust. Previously I’ve been able to get an Otterbox Defender Series case without MagSafe, which made it so no metal dust got into my device. But with the new cases having a notch in the side and no versions without MagSafe… I’m just frustrated.  I know I’d fall into the minority of users. People like MagSafe and like buttons with functionality that makes device usage easier… but it isn’t worth the drawbacks for me. I have an iPhone 12 Pro and wanted to upgrade. I was torn between the 15 Pro Max or the 16 Pro Max. I decided to just go for the better device but I just wish I could opt out of the button and MagSafe within the software and with third party cases.",1727740800,0,

(D)No one comes to the Father (E)except through Me.  *Did you know you’re part of the ultimate statistics, 10 out of 10 people die. One day your heart will stop beating and you will be dead! The Bible says you’ll then be judged by the holy and righteous God who created this universe.(Hebrew 9:27)You’ll be judged for every word, thought, and action in your life.(Matthew 12:36-37) Will you be innocent or guilty?  *Let’s check the standard, the Ten Commandments. Have you ever lied (even a “white” lie)? (Revelation 21:8) Have you ever stolen anything (value is irrelevant and includes downloading or copying movies illegally)?  If you’ve lusted, you’ve committed adultery in your heart. (Matthew 5:27-30) (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)  If you’ve hated someone, the Bible says you’re a murderer(1 John 3:15). If you’ve done any of these things, you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. God is perfect and He hates sin, but He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the Cross to take the punishment you deserve. Then He rose from the graves after three days  – defeating death. (Luke 24:46-48)  Repent (turn from your sins) and trust in Jesus Christ our Lord and saviour  to receive forgiveness and everlasting life afterlife here on earth without pain, suffering and death anymore (revelation 21:4) God cannot Lie He is holy, Righteous and just cannot tolerate Sin(Hebrew 6:18) if you don’t believe in God you are making God a liar. Think about it.  Do you think God cannot preserve His words ? He created the heaven and the earth and the sea all living things here on earth including human.  . Read the Bible to learn about God and how to live. (Acts 20:21)   *Do God’s will, plan and purpose in your life; these are above and beyond, immeasurable compare to your grandest dream.  * We obey God’s moral law the Ten Commandments because we love our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ, the Father and the Holy Ghost(John 14:15) (John 14:1-6) (John 14:16-26) (Mark 12:30-31)  with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength, and we believe and have faith in Him; also we Fear Him with reverence with deep respect.   Job 28:28 King James Version 28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.  1 Corinthians 6:9-10 New King James Version 9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. (A)Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor [a]homosexuals, nor [b]sodomites, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.  Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 New King James Version 13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:  (A)Fear God and keep His commandments, For this is man’s all. 14 For (B)God will bring every work into judgment, Including every secret thing, Whether good or evil.  * Let’s seek the Lord and His face also His strength, power, wisdom and discernment in our daily lives.  We need God’s help to overcome Sin in our lives. And live a holy life in the eyes of the Living God.   God will help us if we seek Him diligently with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength .  Put on always the full armour of God (Ephesians 6:10-18)  Philippians 4:13 New King James Version 13 I can do all things (A)through [a]Christ who strengthens me.  Psalm 28:7 New King James Version 7 The Lord is (A)my strength and my shield; My heart (B)trusted in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, And with my song I will praise Him.  Acts 20:21 King James Version 21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.  God bless.   Living water.",1727740800,1,

Until relatively recently, that was usually all you got.  I know some video fans really like the whole Black Frame Insertion stuff to reduce LCD smear, and that requires frames between frames, hence panels with higher FPS.  But with OLED, AFAIK, that's not really an issue anymore.  Supposedly most of my stuff will do >60Hz now.

I like 60Hz more than 30Hz, as you would expect, but that's about where my preference ends.  60 to 120 is so deep into diminishing returns that, especially on a phone, I just can't understand why there's so much vitriol in this thread.

I can always come back if I don't like it. But I'm tired of the same old same old.   and STEVE JOBS BE ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE AT THAT CAMERA BUTTON. That button goes against everything he was trying to accomplish. there's nothing you can do with that button that you cant already do on the screen or could have been built into the software to be easily accessible from the touch screen. The camera button being added tells me without a doubt that they had NO IDEA what to do to make it special. They are literally out of ideas.   and the reason I think they wont update the airpods max is because they have MILLIONS sitting from when they were originally made and weren't as big a hit as they thought. They need to get through all that inventory and they are not willing to take a loss of money so they literally keep the price the same for 4 years!! and people will continue to buy it slowly because its apple.   It honestly makes me mad that we are so gullible as a society.   Its like when they introduced the double tap as this NEW ground breaking feature on the apple watch last year even though it had been a feature in the watch settings for some time. Apple IMHO are the best at gaslighting there customers. Cant blame them though because it works.

Sure, wireless headphones are cool and all without having cords in the way, but then I'd have to worry about the battery life on those, and if I lose them?  Guess what, I now have to buy another pair of headphones, or an earbud replacement.  Plus, you never know if latency will be cooperative or not when you have your smart device in your pocket.

They made separate buttons for action you could use your TOUCH-screen for. This is literally going backwards.  For some reason people decided Apple is like this godlike company but all they do is: 1.continue to make overpriced phone; 2. give the worst customer service known to man all the while being notorious for implementing systems that harms 3rd party repair and thus the consumer.

It gets it's name from the medieval latin, ultramarinus and it was named that for being a very vibrant shade of blue, Ultra meaning 'beyond'. Marinius is of or relating to the sea. So 'beyond the sea' so a blue that surpasses even the blue of the sea aka very blue (but actually it gets it's name because the lapis was imported from china which was beyond the Mediterranean Sea, so the blueness of the dye has nothing to do with it's name really). A fun fact is in many biblical paintings it was used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, as it is one of the most expensive dyes, surpassing even the material of gold, so it was often used to show of the wealth of cathedrals especially in Venice.",1727740800,3,

UgyFOTujZr1QuV8CJxx4AaABAg,root,@horsthorst11,I used to be an apple fan boy since the iphone 3G launch (I‘m 28 years old now). But the last few years just killed that. Apple products used to be so exciting but now they stick to minimal updates every single year. It used to be a big update every two years and a minor more refined one with the S series. They should have kept that going. And I‘m especially disappointed by the apple watch. I‘m still on the watch 7 because I want a MATTE BLACK titanium finish. And the ultra is just bulky and ugly imo. Why didn‘t they add a durable matte titanium finish for the series 10? My watch 7 is years old and it still amazes me how the titanium doesn‘t have a single scratch because I accidentally hit it against a rough-cast wall like three times a week (I‘m pretty clumsy obviously). I might just pay 200$ to change the battery because besides that (79% capacity) I won‘t change for a glossy one. And don‘t get me started on the glossy aluminium jet black apple watch. Just think about the jet black iphone seven. Horrible idea. Rant over.,1727740800,0,

If you bought a non pro model then its ok to switch after 2 years to pro. Someone who doesn’t have filthy money to spend shouldn’t really upgrade. Cause I have 13 and I am still satisfied with my device. I will upgrade to a pro model after a year or so. Its true that when apple includes a new feature which android already has for years they does better and it’s perfect. I think they are gen’s behind Android in features department. My thoughts when I was going to buy an iPhone was “Rather than buying a mid budget or flagship android which will slow down with updates and then I have to change it again its better to buy an iPhone and then just change the battery when its below 80 and its good as new.” But what they are doing after 13 is just stupidity and those who are buying making their stupid beliefs stronger. There’s no big Physical change with the phones, they are launching AI but not all the devices get it, I mean its ok for 14 series to not get but 15? WOW. Android phones are getting AI in mid budget phones. Apple has the upper hand because like android they dont have multiple companies making their phones based on their os with diff diff hardware and custom ROMs which makes developers life hell to really optimise the hardware to its full potential where iPhones are optimised to their full hardware potential and os is good and compatible.",1727740800,0,

Also, we are going to have to start having 'that' discussion about how discombobulated iOS UI has become. Between the UI for the action button, the new flashlight UI, and a range of other things not even remotely matching the rest of the 'flat' UI, you gotta wonder what the hell is going over on at Apple HQ.

I have an XR (yep 😂), and I have to replace it--it just doesn’t work well anymore (it lags terribly and often just drops all pretenses of trying to find any sort of signal, and then I have to restart it, etc.). But I keep my phones until they need to be replaced so I want to choose carefully. I want a fantastic camera, but I’d rather downgrade the camera a tad than deal with massive file sizes. But I’d really love that 5x zoom if it’s really going to be a noticeable step above the 3x (my husband has the 14  Max). I won’t use the AI stuff, I just don’t need it and don’t care about it, I want to be able to hold the phone and type a text with one hand, I want the phone to be sturdy (I will put an Otterbox Defender on it but I’ve heard the 15s are more prone to breaking), and I don’t want it overheating. I live in Kentucky and it’s been over 110 degrees with some regularity the past few summers, and I’ve heard the 15s tend to overheat. Also, I want my young son to easily be able to call emergency services from my phone on his own. What phone would you recommend? I’m considering 14 Plus, 15 Pro (not really thinking the Max would work because they’re so big?), or waiting for a 16 Pro. Also open to suggestions.

Content is still big and bright and sharp as needed, but it's that noticeable touch more handy to hold and interact with. No one is using a case in the ads- keep that in mind! Just to chunky in the end. (Talking about the small/regular version) I think for the ones who prefer 'smaller' phones and the general who just buys whatever they be presented with, they should have stopped it there! Since the SE or 13 mini oor even xs aren't that much of an alternative anymore. Sadly.   I think the most important aspects of an iphone are: (battery) performance, look and cameras; and i'm really curious if they further took the route of  less/better software image processing. Since the 15 did better in that regard than basically every iphone for years. 48px, nice! SmartHDR 5 and the new photonic engine performed way better!   The AI gatekeeping stuff is irrelevant tbh. Its certainly nice to have it deeper integrated, but many features are accessible, just not via integration.",1727740800,0,

I typically watch their whole 2-plus hour event but not I watch a 10-minute highlight instead. Apple has lost its flair. They have had boring events ever since the iOS 7. It used to be rumors of products but now we all know what's coming out before any event. So that kills the thrill. So what if they added a new button on the phone. It's a phone, not a camera and for the past several years Apple's focus has been making a camera with phone features. The iOS is lame, but they insist on making many updates before the release. The UI is horrible and the icons are too. Oh, they put in a customizing icon feature. It's just changing the background color of the icons. Apple needs to come out with more products to win over people again. Apple needs to come out with a TV, and household products and not just have the Home app for lightbulbs, sneakers that track your posture or steps, or a car.",1727740800,0,

Anyone remember the AirMask?  Nothing really hypes me up to get the new iPhone. It’s nice that they’re going to have Apple Intelligence, but, yeah, it’s not going to be released anytime soon, so why am I going to pay for a new iPhone that won’t be able to utilize the new features?

Would consider upgrading if I can afford to (but I probably won't this year; my iPhone 11 is still great except for the lightning port and there's other things that need money right now).

Ugww-pjaBUrWlnvf_yh4AaABAg,root,@JeffKJr,"I hope Apple keeps the Camera controls in-line on the screen by default unless you hide them or use the physical button instead. Sometimes it may be more intuitive to use on-screen controls instead of the button, especially at first. With that said, I think there’s an accessibility perspective to both traditional controls and the new hardware button. As someone with only the practical use of one hand, I could see the on-screen camera controls being potentially more useful and efficient to me while in landscape mode and the hardware button more while in the portrait orientation. I don’t know; we’ll (eventually) see how it goes. The battery improvements, screen size increases and the new 48MP camera make me think about upgrading from my 14P. As AI branding becomes more prominent and omnipresent, I would think of the potential purchase as future proofing — even if the 17 Series turns out to be a redesign. (I’m definitely upgrading to the S10 from the S4 because this little notification machine’s software updates are about to be cut off with the release of WatchOS 11. Poor thing. Lol)",1727740800,0,

There's no reason to bump the version number with 1% spec increases.  This yearly cycle IS ridiculous, because not enough changes in one year to make it worth releasing a whole new product.  Would anyone seriously miss the ""innovation"" in the 16 vs the 15?  Then why not just sell the 15 for a year longer?  If you need a new phone, there's a perfectly good one to choose, right there.  It doesn't need to be less than 365 days old to be relevant.  TBH, it could probably go on a three-year cadence, since many of the useful new features aren't hardware, it's software -- and even that gets stretched a bit thin in their yearly MacOS / IOS updates.  Instead, we get everyone thinking ""oh there will a new one just around the corner, better wait for that before buying"" simultaneous with a collective yawn and a sentiment of ""there's barely anything different 'cept colors this year"".  And the whole cottage industry of accessories has to re-tool to accommodate the power button moving up by 1/2 mm, just so somebody can tell the difference when holding two generations side-by-side.

And that's the point that's being made— there's no reason for you to upgrade every single year, so unless you are for whatever reason, it's kind of a moot critique. Just don't buy the latest phone if you have one within 1-3 generations. And if you do, you have no one else to blame but yourself because there's 0 incentive in doing so (for now).

I know how much better Android has it on features but here's the thing, I really just don't care lol I don't put enough thought into phones anymore to where I care about what I'm missing out on. You want a dirty secret? I keep my iphone on battery saver 24/7. I love how much quieter it is. I have my PC as well as an Xbox in half my rooms. I never used my iphone for the performance and I bet a lot of you don't either but if you do that's okay too, one day you'll grow up lol. The one reason I have an iPhone and never think about buying an Android (apart from a few really special phones back when I cared) is because my entire family has ios which means we can almost talk to each other literally any time of the day because we all have either an iphone or iPad or laptop with iOS and the messages all come through. At the age my parents are at, you never know when your last text or goodbye with them will be so As much as these iphones are ""behind"" or whatever you want to say about them, Android does not have anything to even compete in the sense of iMessage and how well implemented that is to everything else. I don't buy iphones because I don't know what I'm missing out on, I buy them because I know exactly what I would be missing if I switched to Android.

I actually owned the APM for a week or so but returned them because I could not live with how much they cost. The APM sounded really good. I gave up waiting for Apple to improve and lower their price on the APM. I am now into Audio File quality equipment. I have Focal Bathys ,Focal Elegia, Sennheiser 660s, Sony MDR 7508, and Bowers and Wilkins PX& S2E for over the ear listening. I also have In Ear Monitors (IEM) such as the iDUN Kinera, KZ HBB PR2, KZ ZS10 Pro and even Moondrop Chu IEMs. I would still like to own APM but not until the price drops. I cannot believe Apple has not improved APM. Oh, I also bought Digital Audio Players(DAP) namely the HiBy R5II and the HiBy R6III for listening to music as well as Digital Audio Converters (DAC) to augment the DAP and to use with iPhone 16 Pro Max that will increase the iPhone volume regardless of Iphones volume warning. It is nice for Apple to be concerned for my hearing but I already have a set of parents. I also have a separate volume amplifier that will boost volume out of the control of any phone. I like listening to music a bit louder than the warning levels. Yes it will affect my hearing but I am ok with that! Thanks again for your review and honesty.",1727740800,0,

I still like the form factor too much, and I haven't been convinced to give that up just yet.  The very least, I know I want to upgrade my gen 1 SE watch to the series 10, but that's mainly because of how my watch can't last a full day anymore and is missing some of the more important software bonuses newer watches have. That black finish (thank god they are moving away from the midnight-not-black-but-not-blue-either finish) also looks sleek, and surprisingly Apple didn't kill off the small version of the watch which is nice.

I have an Apple Watch series 7. Don't really use it to its full potential. All I have it for is alerts and a few apps on the face, such as weather. Don't think I'd benefit much from upgrading.   Been waiting for a while to see an AirPods Max update. Really tempted to grab the small updated model, but I do wish a gen 2 was a thing. They did nothing about the ""case"", lack of folding for travel, or even a power button. Also not thrilled with the order options. Why can we not mix and match the bands with the ear pads? This seems like a basic option to give us. They do this with the Apple Watch and the bands for that, letting us pick what bands come with it. Just makes sense to do the same for the AirPods Max.

The Pro is about as thick as I'd like my device, personally.  Example: The Pro is .02 thicker in depth, which is just enough to be too thick to have a case without it feeling awkward in my hand. Is there a reason they cannot maintain the same wait as the original model?   The iPhone 15/16 is just about where I'd want a phone for comfort. Ironically, the 16 is .02 lighter than the 15.

There are people who still need Touch ID and must avoid MagSafe wireless charging — senior citizens, people with disabilities, people with health issues etc. People with certain health related issues must avoid so called “MagSafe” and wireless charging because it’s actually not safe for use around some life sustaining medical devices. Some senior citizens and people with disabilities are still using the iPhone SE because it still has the Touch ID and don’t have MagSafe and wireless charging. And it’s possible to include Touch ID via a side button on all iPhones, if Apple chose to just add it. For examples, the iPad mini has the Touch ID button built-in on the side of it. It’s simple! As for the MagSafe  wireless charging, Apple seems to be on track to adding it to all of their iPhones, including the SE version. That’s going to very bad news for people who have ICD and other medical devices. Can everybody please call Apples Accessibility Department and ask them to think about these concerns?

However, for someone with a 1-4 year old phone, upgrading isn't really worth it—replacing the battery is usually more than enough. The improvements over the past few years mainly benefit users who run complex or processor-intensive apps. For the average person, their current phone is likely still perfectly fine.",1727740800,0,

For the next biggest update , in however many years , the idea of it being referred to as a phone should become obsolete. The “phone” should just eventually just be a feature in what the device has morphed into. I know people who rarely even use it to make phone calls and conduct the majority of their communications through messages throughout multiple applications. And the camera is another huge part of why it shouldn’t be just called an iPhone. It should be called something else and start a whole new series of next generation mobile devices and Apple can start a whole new category. It will eventually morph into a powerful computer supercharged with AI completely aware of its surroundings and context when you pull it out. You can pull out the device and it will have integrated AR displayed information with pass through view when you hold it up like the Vision Pro , to most surroundings including directions in space etc. One example is that it could be just called simply , the Pod, or AIPod.  The AIPod can revolutionize the way we view mobile phones and get past the idea of it just being a phone and move into the future. Apple can pioneer this transition in my opinion. Imagine a world where we say “hey let me see your pod” instead of phone .   Image pulling out your AIPod and it looks like holding up a transparent piece of glass with floating apps, eye tracing like pausing videos when you look away, scrolling with touch sensors on the side of the phone instead of touching the screen, and a battery that is its own layer with the whole surface area of the phone to maximize power etc. That’s what I want to see after the iPhone 20.",1727740800,0,

They just want a phone is better than the one they currently have. More importantly, most people don't replace their phone every year. The old days of 2-year contracts is long over, but it's stuck most people into replacing their phone every 2-4 years. I have a 12 pro, and the 16 pro will be a huge improvement, so the marginal improvements over the 15 pro aren't a factor. Even more importantly, the ux and OS are the main differences. You could give an everyday person the most advanced android device ever. Imagine 0mm bezels, a billion gigs ram, 1.21 gigawatts cpu, 7 trillion mhz refresh rate... they'll still hate using it because Material Design is trash.

It's just your iSheep mentality that keeps you stuck with iPhones. On the other hand, Android offers much better customization. Not everyone gets bored, because customization allows users to try different setups on the same phone, unlike Apple, where the OS has been the same since 2015. At least they copied a few Material UI elements from Android, so now you have something to customize.  first, buy the best Android hardware, and then comment. I can bet you a million dollars that you won't feel any difference. Android phones used to lag in the past, but things have changed. Now, Android is the best, offering enthusiast features all year long and tons of different options for different needs. So before you comment on something you don't know about Android, just keep quiet!  And the funny thing is, why would someone who loves basic things spend $1,000 on a phone? If you just want a phone for casual use, a $300 Android phone is more than enough.

As for volume control instead of making it a capacitive slider (as that would result in accidental volume adjustment) use the pressure sensitivity for the upper and lower portions of the button to adjust volume.

That's how the market goes.  Phones have reached a plateau of sorts... you're not gonna get huge, ground-breaking advancements every year.  Incremental upgrades are the norm for the industry, because phones do so much nowdays, there really isn't much more they can cram into them - and when they do, it's usually software, not hardware.  And yes, Androids are the same way.  Slightly better battery, slightly faster chip, slightly better camera... you know the drill.  Expect the same for the Samsung S25 when it gets announced as well.  That said, the camera button is a nice touch, and AI is cool for the phones that get it.  But what else were you people realistically expecting?  I'm not saying the phone is perfect and that there isn't room for improvement... but I think some of yall just like complaining.  😁",1727740800,0,

Apple has long coasted on it's software excellence and AI (har, har) will push that to a limit since it is more defined by the software. With all the push for GAI, a thing that I have noticed is a deemphasis on hardware. So long as it can keep up, to alot of these manufactures don't really care what GAI does. My concern is this... what happens when GAI fails, because it will, and having some redundancy will be important. Also, this is Apple in the depth of Silicon Valley, it's also a massive question of what assumptions Apple is making with GAI (given it's rather complex relationship with ML and other companies), and how built into the system they are.",1727740800,0,

Look, why Apple is not making any huge changes or redesigns in these iPhone, even if a niche of people really want to see an iPhone which is not an iPhone like a foldable phone is   1. That will cost too much in Apple's part and makes the consumer pay too much for it for the R&D, marketing, tax etc.  2. They don't really need to, especially everything in this phone is actually great in what it is, like because people complain about the 60hz refresh rate but iOS is actually smoother than Android cause of the optimizations.   3. They trying to put attention to detail or fixing essential problems to these phones, generation to generation,  although some want something different and completely new.  Look, I'm not saying that Apple is not being innovative, but to be honest they are a innovative into products that came before it and refine it to many people's interests like the iPhone 16. When you compare it to iPhone X, iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 series which are aging, this is a big upgrade to people and hell  the upgrades like the camera capture, 4k 120 and robust camera system and apps is my upgrades in that demographic of people or anyone at this point but cannot appeal everyone.  For me in the review I want to see how can the camera capture will be versatile in many situations in photography and videography and if can take screenshot better than stupid way of doing. Also did Apple magsafe charging speed match what they say cause of the Google fiasco of Pixel 9 series being slower, cause charging and battery are very important to me.

While I appreciate the new Pro models featuring two 48 MP cameras and the dedicated camera button, I'm feeling that this year's upgrades are not worth the trade-in or upgrade for me. My iPhone 15 Pro Max is in very good condition, with a battery life still at 99%.   I think I've reached the end of the road with iPhone, as the changes year after year have felt minimal. It's time for me to explore something new and switch to the Android side!   Can anyone recommend a flagship Android phone for 2024? I still plan to keep my 15 Pro Max as a secondary device.

They do the opposite and always over promise and under deliver on announcements now. I was ready to buy an AWU 3 but they didn't change anything with the AWU 2😂. I bought a iPhone 15 Pro last year after trading in my 11 Pro (I personally feel was the best designed iPhone for your hand and for the quality), and they would honestly have to make a lot of changes for me to want to upgrade. Why don't we have more freedom with Shortcuts and more freedom with the Home app. Why can't I add a member of the household who can only control certain products? The files app is not good. Reverse wireless charging for AirPods. A personal hotspot that doesn't continually disconnect. Why is rotation lock only in one orientation? Separate from Apple, I hate that even though I have stuff downloaded on Spotify, it still decides to stream it and use up data for no reason whatsoever. I have unlimited data, but it's so annoying when it's download on the device and it takes 20 to 30 seconds to start playing because I came out of the parking garage and would rather stream it than play the downloaded copy. I know I can put it in offline mode, but what if I switch to something I don't have downloaded like a podcast? And then I have to go into my settings and make sure it is no longer in that mode. Then I can play it. Also, as I'm typing this, I swear diction has gotten worse on Mac.

Adding to that, I have been fond of utilizing the volume buttons to conveniently snap or record something when I don't want to stain my screen or when the shutter's rather inaccessible (reachability problems when tilted on the other side). This is also an ode to other iPhone adopters who used Lumia, Samsung Galaxy, LG, and HTC, among others.  I really don't see it as comparable to the still-bleak fate of the action button that was perhaps only an afterthought to fortify device water resistance, and the fact that the old mute switch mostly fails on thinner models before , e.g. the iPhone 6 since dust collects in it diminishing usability. The iPhone's only getting thinner and I suppose it will inevitably be on that path. Might only be me on this one but the Camera Control button's been a long time coming, and I don't know how they didn't think of this before.",1727740800,1,

By introducing this button for a ""not-so-essential"" function like camera control (Since you can still do it via screen), apple is going to get tons of usage data on how do people interact, quality of UX (Software, Hardware) and the physical quality of this button. Who knows, they may merge couple of buttons and make a single, longer button, like volume slider for example with extra functions similar to camera button (tap, double tap, slide etc), similarily action & power buttons can have ""extra interactive"" features which is currently limited to 1 or 2 functions.",1727740800,0,

Somebody like myself would 8 times out of 10 never use the pro features on the camera. The basic functionality would be absolutely fine with me. That said. As far as the 60hz display on the base model that’s the only thing truly separating the two models. If the regular iPhone 16 and 16 plus had Pro Motion display the pro model sales would take a huge hit! And once again honestly only the tech community and people who have used a phone with 120 refresh rate will know the difference anyway! 60 is still just fine for a large amount of smartphone users. Not everyone wants to play resident evil on their smartphone or care about always on display and for those people the 16 and 16 plus is powerhouse of a smartphone for those who love iOS and the Apple ecosystem,1727740800,0,

So comparing last year's model simply doesn't make sense. Where was iPhone four years ago? iPhone 12. That's significant progress. Good job, Apple. Phones are now to a point where replacing them every four years actually makes sense. It's better for the environment, more responsible with your money, and lets you justify getting the top model since you'll keep it for a bit.",1727740800,0,

I have a pair of AirPods 3, and they won't stay in my ears for more than 15 minutes.  I had to buy little soft-rubber sheaths to put around them which helps to hook them into my ears.

UgxH8mi74WQPwwsIFgN4AaABAg,root,@brettfourie3496,So we know each year it’s a slight increment improvement on the iPhones.   So what I’m interested in finding out like which generation would benefit the most with the upgrade ? I don’t mean like someone rocking a 4s to 16 - that’s clear. But like would a 13 to 16 see a big improvement?   10-20% better than last year. Could mean if it’s from 4 years ago it could be a 40-80% improvement. Which would be noticeable.   Would be interesting to let someone go is on an older generation phone play with it for a few days to see if it’s a massive upgrade or not.   The AI stuff sounds interesting but at the end of the day not sure if I’m going to buy a phone because of that.,1727740800,0,

Somehow... owning an iphone makes you cool  But when people realize that there are phones out there that do so much more than apple, so much more often, and won't inconvenience your pocket. It's just sad honestly.  Apple still haven't addressed their overheating issues. Best solution is a really good vapor chamber, cool off all the heat from gen-moji, camera use and gaming or whatever.  Apple can't run games with proper stability, they always hitch and drop in quality during use. Add more ram for background tasks. Nobody cares how efficient ram use is. 8gb is not nearly enough.   And lastly, almost every cheap and mid tier phone comes with 5000mah batteries out the box. Apple has 4 versions of every flagship and NONE of them ever came close to 5000mah battery.  10 years in a row and apple been half assing their own upgrades and limiting their own selves.

UgzqGp9kXYmgHJoeDyt4AaABAg,root,@mohammedfaiisal,"Regular models are a horrible buy. They have been a horrible buy since the 14 came out. But now, it's even worse, because a17 pro is better than the a18 and this still has no 120hz display. You are getting a better deal by buying the previous years pro models for the same or slightly less. Why would anyone buy the regular 16?  Not sure why everyone is saying the position of the camera button is better to use horizontally. I find it easier to use it vertically. Usually my thumb is resting there anyway. I find it less complicated and less finger gymnastics vertically, than horizontally. Especially since it's a little too high up for horizontal use and in the perfect spot for vertical use  No apple watch ultra 3 is a shame, especially since the watch 10 has the newer chip and new slim design and more screen for the larger one than the ultra and also, being able to play music. The ultra 2 is outdated. I have a feeling the ultra 3 next year will have the same chip as this years series 10 that will also be on the 11. I am very sure about it  I still can't believe that there's no airpods max 2. That's ridiculous. All or most companies release new headphones every 2 years and same for earbuds. This is getting out of hand. Maximum wait for new headphones should be 3 years. Minimum 2 years. Earbuds is about 2 years max but airpods do it, every 3 years. But 4 years later and no airpods max 2 is ridiculous. I hope they release an airpods pro 3 next year and don't do a clever upgrade on the 2 by releasing new colours or something   Those anker products already feel outdated. Because the iPhone can now support 25w wireless charging. The watch charger can also charge a lot faster now. My watch ultra is 18w. I'm not sure what the new watch charging speed is. But it's definitely more than 18w. I'd guess 25w or more. But this foldable charging product, only supports 5w or 15w max, if you're only charging the watch. So it seems outdated and I think anker needs to start working on an updated version, immediately. Something that can support 50w for all three devices or something. 25w for phone, maybe 25w or more for the watch. They need to sort that out.

An SD card slot--which accepts 512 GB cards! And a removable battery! Imagine that.

UgwKOBJ-eNkPi2N6SRx4AaABAg,root,@TAMS1952,"At present, I am utilizing the 15 Pro Max model, and there is no compelling reason to upgrade to the 16 series, particularly the Pro versions. If I were to consider an upgrade, I would opt for the 16 Pro model solely because I would not want to carry a mini computer around. The 6.9-inch screen is just slightly larger than I prefer, so I can see why some Pro Max users in the past would simply purchase the Pro version. One of the most innovative features introduced by Apple is the camera button located on the side of the device. I believe this feature will prove highly beneficial for many users as they become accustomed to its functionality. Notably, it is particularly advantageous for professionals.  The AirPods 2 Pro will offer the remarkable capability of being utilized as a hearing aid later in the fall. While I do not have any hearing impairments, I appreciate the fact that once a hearing assessment is conducted, all elements within the Apple ecosystem adapt to the user’s hearing levels. This adaptation ensures enhanced clarity in audio reception, all without the need to incur exorbitant costs associated with traditional hearing aids.  Each year, Apple announces that this is the most exceptional lineup ever, boasting remarkable battery life. Apple has consistently provided figures indicating the battery’s lifespan over a specified time or usage. However, this year, they have only announced a modest increase in battery size without specifying the battery’s duration on a full charge. In my opinion, the increase in battery size appears to have been an afterthought, with insufficient time to thoroughly test it alongside Apple Intelligence.",1727740800,0,

A zombified nation of iPhone users will be at the door for this one. Very disappointed with the AirPods Max update. Makes me value my AirPods Max (lightning cable version) even more and it feels good to not spend another $549 on something that hasn’t changed much. A lackluster event only for Apple to make money and keep the ecosystem going. I love Apple but I wish people wake up already.,1727740800,0,
UgwE_CMjPNl_sv2Ob-B4AaABAg,root,@stratman103,I was really excited for this one as I'm due to upgrade both my 14 PM and my Gen 8 watch.  Thought for SURE we'd at least get 10x optical zoom and a blood pressure monitor.  Neither.  Why am I upgrading?  The AI I've seen so far has been pretty underwhelming.  Oooh I can make custom emojis.  I am literate so I don't need AI to write or rewrite things for me.  I do like the camera button.  They made the case slightly bigger on the watch so bigger battery?  No.  We made it thinner too because we know you'd rather have thinner over functionality!!!  Boy do I miss Steve Jobs.,1727740800,0,

Same old version 1 chip in it, too. Of all this stuff, improving the mid focal length and ultra-wide sensors on the Pro phones are the only things of interest functionally at all.

The Google Pixel and Pixel Pro both have the same starting price as the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro at $799 and $999 respectively, so it’s safe to say that the pricing issue isn’t isolated to Apple at this point. These are also their flagship phones, and they are priced as such. The iPhone SE is right there for those on a budget, along with older pixel models or other third-party androids.  As for innovations, yeah, a camera control button isn’t revolutionary, but I don’t know what innovations people are expecting in 2024 other than AI implementations. It feels like all these smartphone companies are just releasing the same thing but with different filters at this point. The only major deviation these days are folding phones, but the good ones are still way too expensive to be worthwhile for the average consumer.

And, please Apple, stop with the carbon neutral PR crap… you’re foisting new hardware on us every year and perpetuating the cycle of disposable technology.

Get the avalanche of early adopter apple fanboys  and then go again in a couple of months when you start updating the software and the phone looks brand new again. As for the weird extra buttons that are awkward to reach and don't really assist portrait mode which is what the majority of optics are shot in... the button is 100% designed to leverage sales of their overpriced proprietary cases and the bolt on licensing fees they make from 3rd party stuff.    I'll guarantee you that for every dollar APPLE invested in design and fit out of these buttons they'll gross 20 times that on the case sales from a market that typically buys a number of new cases each year they own the phone.  The Apple play book of smoke and mirrors gets more transparent each and every year.And why hasn't Apple updated the bird daddy AirPods?  Because it's a niche product and doesn't generate anywhere enough sales to support any kind of meaningful update budget. The end,1727740800,0,

UgwuMJXV6G0Gtzgc2dh4AaABAg,root,@SirPeabsSwamprider,"I’m at a loss here. I’m still holding onto my 14 Pro Max because, frankly, Apple just doesn’t seem to care about innovation at the level that made them legendary. Now, don’t get me wrong, I have my reasons for not switching to Android, but it’s hard not to feel disheartened by Apple's lack of urgency to push boundaries anymore. Tim Cook seems perfectly content with rolling out products that feel either outdated or irrelevant, knowing full well that brand loyalty alone will keep people buying. And the thing that really puzzles me is how customers and investors keep rewarding this stagnation. Steve Jobs was a complicated guy, but he got it. He knew that Apple had to innovate and exceed expectations, always setting trends, not following them. I’m seriously questioning whether I can justify dropping over a grand on another iPhone unless Apple rediscovers that mindset.",1727740800,0,

Have you noticed that innovation in technology has steadily decreased in impact and is nowhere near as much as before? Take going from 2D to 3D for example. That alone clears any innovation made in the last 4 years. Literally no one is innovating like before because it's impossible to do so. It's like expecting the 40 year increase in life expectancy from the great medical revolution to happen again. It's nearly impossible. From 2020 onward, it'll just be small stuff that add up over the years.",1727740800,0,

Innovation isn’t just about those rare, mind-blowing breakthroughs. As Marques pointed out, we’re sitting here in 2024, and Apple is still clinging to 60hz displays. Seriously? Are you asking nearly $2k for a phone that feels stuck in 2020? Sure, they claim better battery life but notice how they weren’t exactly eager to back that up with actual specs. 🚩 anyone?  Then there’s the camera button. Really? We’re supposed to get excited about a new button? On a phone? Let’s be honest. No one’s waking up thinking, “Man, if only my phone had another button!” Oh, and it’s thinner and lighter? Wow, ground-breaking stuff, Apple. Maybe there’s some cool software down the road, but maybe it isn’t worth two grand.  At this point, it feels like Apple is taking a page out of Tesla’s playbook: promising big, delivering halfway, charging a premium, and somehow still getting away with it. Can you honestly tell me if Steve Jobs were still around, he’d allow the release of the iPhone 16 Pro Max without a serious upgrade to Siri, something that competes with or beats Google’s AI advancements? Come on.  Look, innovation doesn’t mean you have to reinvent the wheel every time. We’re not expecting a new iPhone to shake up the entire tech world like the iPod did to music. But at the very least, can they start listening to the loyal fans asking for reasonable upgrades for years? Stop treating us like we don’t notice what’s happening. We’re not stupid, and these flashy release events aren’t fooling anyone anymore.",1727740800,0,
UgwuMJXV6G0Gtzgc2dh4AaABAg.A8CcxDrcsNRA8DVybEwKsR,UgwuMJXV6G0Gtzgc2dh4AaABAg,@Sc5ch,"@SirPeabsSwamprider  Only reason they get away with 60hz on the base models is cuz none of the people who buy it even care/notice. A perfect example of the consumers being too stupid to understand they're being taken advantage of. 90% of them have been using 60hz since their first phone.  The 16s have 10% more battery life, and the Pros have around 15% more according to the website. The camera button isn't for normal people. It's for photo enthusiasts or whatever. The main focus this year is AI, which is a huge deal imo, so I really don't get why people are complaining so much. You should be upgrading every 4 years or so, unless you're in a program or something.   This year, the Pros were focused entirely on the cameras. Like I said, they're not for the average user. I think the mics, export speeds, and camera features are great for people who care, I just don't. It's mostly for content creators, I guess.  I honestly think it was simply mid. It wasn't bad at all (maybe because Apple Intelligence is coming as well?). It just seems like this year was all stuff I didn't care about, just like you. Those Tiktokers are probably preordering it right now.   ""They added studio mics and 120fps to the Pros? I need one right now!"" - People who care.   I care way more about the AI and day-to-day productivity stuff. I barely even take photos, so I just don't care. Apparently, the 17 will be the big leap, but idk.",1727740800,0,

It takes time for companies to do localization of software functions. My final point is AI in general. It’s fun to play around with, but it gets boring very quickly and feels like a gimmick if I’m honest.

The USB-C is nice as this is my last lightning cable device but the biggest issue nobody bothers to talk about is the condensation that builds up and hurts them.   I also would have assumed tech for ANC and maybe some other bits and pieces like mics have gotten better that would have been a nice upgrade.

Especially since the 14 and 15 lineup have had very bad battery health. 14 worse than 15 though, but 13 was the last great iPhone though, in terms of stability. Battery health on my 3 year old iPhone is higher than my brothers 15 pro and way higher than my uncles 14 Pro max. It tells you just how bad the 14 and 15 iPhones have been. My mum barely uses the iPhone 14 and her battery health is on 97% mine is on 95% after heavy usage. My mum, who never uses it, other than for calls, texts and taking photos at weddings which we barely go to and hers is on 97% just shows you how bad the battery health has been.

Ugx25plVO-dB6pc-ukd4AaABAg,root,@Nickish01,"Alright, I get. Let me explain: Now when Vision Pro holds the big promise for acquiring a new niche market and becoming the moneymaker, Apple noticeably makes steps toward bringing the existing audience from their strongest product (IPhone).  How are they going to make it?  Lets leave the discussion about camera lenses positioning aside. The content consumption is the simplest and strongest atraction points for their devices. The bridge is going to sound like “check your own shots from an existing gallery in the new way with Vision Pro dimension experience”. That gives them an opportunity to establishing emotional (such as nostalgia) connection with an unfamiliar device.   To make things mentioned above happen, Apple faces the challenge of returning masses to capturing videos in the old landscape orientation instead of nowadays popular vertical format (which also took years to establish).  How do you break such a strong trend?  Today we are presented with a new and obviously important for the company feature - physical button on a side. How cool, right?  It’s simply made for the convenience of capturing landscape orientation content. But it still is just another button, which Steve tried so hard to get rid off.  Well now we get a new extra one for the second year in a row. Gotcha, Apple!",1727740800,0,

I’m upgrading from the 15 Pro Max (but I upgrade every year through Apple’s upgrade program) for the camera button, larger screen, and better battery life primarily. I have the AirPods Max since they came out, and still love them. No reason to upgrade. I’ll carry a lightning cable around to charge them. I have AirPods Pro 2. No hardware upgrade needed, although I’ve been enjoying Apple’s occasional firmware improvements. Upgrading to the black watch Ultra. But that’s a nerd edge case. I have the Ultra 1 and a series 7 stainless steel. I alternate between the two. It’s cheaper for me to trade in the Ultra 1 and get this Ultra if I want one of each, than to upgrade to the series 10 and trade in my series 7.",1727740800,0,

There were 5 children, not sure if they went one, triplets, one or two individual births then triplets.  They were all born with hoofen hands and this made it nearly impossible for them to do anything, tie shoes, write, perform everyday tasks etc, but one thing they were all good at was music and they had really good voices.  Being unable to actually play instruments their father fashioned an attachment they could use to hold drumsticks which would fit over their hoofs. They didn't have a lot of money so ended up splitting one drumkit between 4 with all 4 playing the rhythm together and the fith singing the lead vocal.

I also like how it unlocks my notifications to show me their content only when I look at the phone, without opening the phone up and going past the lock screen. Face id is also more secure than the best mobile phone fingerprint scanners to the best of my knowledge. Closing your eyes or not paying attention also doesn't allow the phone to unlock.

Large touchscreens are very expensive, specially an oled one with higher touch sample rate (240hz for 120hz refresh rate for apple standards). That display won't be 2000 nits either. The oled displays also need to have a ppi of at least 218ppi for monitors (iphone's have 460ppi). There is currently no monitor on the market that is oled and has a ppi of 218 or more at 27inches. The apple studio display is hits 218ppi at 27inches but isn't an oled. That display will also need to be mass manufactured at a scale not experienced by monitor manufacturers and have better reliability and longevity than the standard. The battery hit from the 120hz panel on the phone will mean you have to have a larger battery (i'm sick of big heavy phones) or an ltpo display which can vary its refresh rate and match it beautifully to the software. Monitors are terrible. I've tried so many of them and they're all washed out, have no contrast, terrible viewing angles, terrible matt coating, low ppi, low brightness or low refresh rate.

If you want to talk innovation let’s talk apple intelligence, I haven’t been a fan of iphones (besides their cameras) since iphone4s but with the level of innovation brought by apple this year has made me a fan again.   Ig you can’t make everyone happy, but whining about a feature only being available in certain models is the most first world problem nonsense I’ve seen all year.   120hz demands twice as many frames from your phone which takes a toll on the battery.

It is indeed a bit Pro level thing for a smartphone to have a dedicated Camera button with so many functionalities hidden inside it & it could have been a distinctive feature to separate the Pro from the non-Pro models. Non-Pro already got that Action button this year.. it was enough for that. If anything, Apple should have given 120Hz to 16 & 16Plus while upgrading 16Pro & 16Pro Max to 144Hz.

What he is saying is that if a phone is launched at a price as high as an ipHone 16 or iPhone 16 plus, it should have a high refresh rate panel and usb 3.0 speeds. Which is in no way a flagship worthy feature in 2024. Even phones that cost a third of an iPhone have these features because just like ram, they are cheap to implement and are quality of life features that give users more value. Your argument that it does not matter to a normal user does not make sense because its not some obscure neural engine whose AI chomps don’t affect most people. The refresh rate leads to smooth gameplay and scolling on a phone , which feels fast! Most “normal” people use their smartphone as primary camera device. Having usb 3.0 speeds will make their backup speed up 10x and will save a lot of time. Having more ram will make the device work smoothly for a longer time and your “normal” user won’t have to upgrade their device as frequently nor will have to face slowdowns . “Normal” users also spend a lot of money on buying these phones, hence they deserve industry standard features for the money they are paying.

Where the base of it all is that we might, legitimately, be near a hardware ceiling when it comes to running a business off of your hardware (ie, not optimizing for bleeding edge ‘cool’ stuff). They’ve got to worry about usability and the common consumer (among other things). To that end, the improvements are fine. Doubly so when the ‘meaningful’, capability expanding, innovation is happening around software (AI).  On the other hand, it’s exciting to see big swings from a company like Apple. And it’s exciting for a company like Apple to show why they are lauded; for them to prove themselves as innovators every year. If everyone was an innovator (ie, the idea that people should always come with examples of improvements / innovations) then no one is an innovator.  People want new and exciting ways to interact with the world through technology. They want, seemingly, new paradigms. And, they expect a company like Apple to deliver on that.  Note: I will say that the role out and ‘support’ thus far of the Apple Vision Pro seems lackluster. Maybe it’s thriving in the background. Regardless, I do have my doubts on Apple’s ability to actually push their bleeding edge stuff. So, that’s also a knock for people calling for big swings.",1727740800,0,

Remembering the genesis of the smartphone, and the people who genuinely needed the functionality of those phones and to see those features take a back seat to MOAR CAMERA is sorta ridiculous.   Something as simple as their calculator, up to opening large excel files on the go. improvements in word processing and using spreadsheets.. maybe I didn't carry my laptop and want to make changes to a visualisation or dashboard I created. It's like the idea of professional for them doesn't pass a limited scope. And it's not just about being able to do these things but having personally tried to open a large workbook on my iPhone, trust me.. a return to basics, reimagining and reinvigorating the essence of the smartphone would solidify them, rather than the same gimmicky nonsense they release each year.

Not much about it not being available right away (not great either, but fair) - but about lack of clarity. 2025 - yes but when, where? In all the languages or just the ones they showed?  Is it possible they don’t know themselves? I understand the EU regulation-panorama isn’t easy but still.. Either way - not good.   Lack of clarity can push many users to competitors - especially those that already introduced AI on device. e.g If Samsung S25 will release a new sick design with growing AI features while Apple Intelligence is still not in EU… I smell problems for Apple.

All on the own back in the days. He earned and deserves it. Many and I mean many YouTubers would want to switch with his position.

Face recognition does usually offer this on Android but it is far slower and less reliable due to being dependent on lighting.

Android just has too many options, hits too many price points, and has too many manufacturers innovating for Apple to ever gain dominance beyond beating individual brands. Add to that the fact that Apple refuses to actually USE standards until forced to do so. USB-C, RCS, higher refresh rate screens, APP DRAWERS. Apple continually lags behind when it comes to features.

It's not a problem, but its an option. Yes you can unlock using your pin instead, but what about all the fuss that face ID is fast, using pin is not fast, but hey still an option right? So there is no reason for not putting touch ID under the screen or on the side button. Its all a safe choice, safe play for Apple themselves, if they gonna release a new model in the future, but not much feature to add, oh hey we can add back the Touch ID that we've kept just for this specific scenario then we call it new, refreshing, improved security, revolutionary.
